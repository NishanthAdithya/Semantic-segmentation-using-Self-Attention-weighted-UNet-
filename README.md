# Semantic-segmentation-using-Self-Attention-weighted-UNet-

Semantic segmentation is a fundamental task in
computer vision, involving the classification of each pixel in
an image. This paper presents an enhanced U-Net architecture
augmented with a self-attention mechanism to better capture
long-range dependencies and improve segmentation performance.
The method is evaluated on the Oxford-IIIT Pet dataset, demon-
strating improved accuracy and boundary delineation compared
to classical U-Net.
